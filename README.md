# Fleetmacs (Emacs keymap for Jetbrains Fleet) #

Many people love Emacs and its keymap,
but Emacs lacks proper support
for Kotlin. Therefore,
we use Jetbrains Fleet as an alternative.
For those who prefer the Emacs keymap,
I have recreated it for Fleet.

## Installation 

For install this keymap, just replace user.json in Fleet's keymap location.
