# Fleetmacs (Emacs keymap for Jetbrains Fleet) #

Many people love Emacs and its keymap,
but Emacs lacks proper support
for Kotlin. Therefore,
we use Jetbrains Fleet as an alternative.
For those who prefer the Emacs keymap,
I have recreated it for Fleet.

## Why is the plugin not in the Fleet Marketplace?

This plugin is not available in Jetbrains Fleet because an official plugin 
from Jetbrains with support for the Emacs keymap will be released in the next version. 
However, if you still want to use this layout before the new version is released, 
you can check the installation instructions in https://github.com/pank-su/fleetmacs/issues/4.
